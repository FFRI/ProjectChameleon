# Project Chameleon

## About this project

CHPE stands for Compiled Hybrid PE, which contains both x86 (or x86\_64) code and Arm64 code.
The special PE files are distributed for reducing the amount of JIT binary translation by `xtajit.dll` (or `xtajit64.dll`).
You can find the more detailed explanations at [Cylance Research Team's Blog](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2019/09/teardown-windows-10-on-arm-x86-emulation) and ["WoW64 internals ...re-discovering Heaven's Gate on ARM."](https://wbenny.github.io/2018/11/04/wow64-internals.html)

These PE files were previously located only at `%SystemRoot%\SysChpe32`.
However, after the introduction of x64 emulation feature, much of the DLLs at `%SystemRoot%\System32` have become a new type of CHPE called CHPEV2 ARM64EC and ARM64X.

This project collects reverse engineering results of CHPEV2.

- [Handmade `GetProcAddress` to get the native "#..." arm64 function](./arm64ec_dllimport) (Thanks @DavidXanatos)

## Why "Chameleon" ?

This is because "VsDevCmd.bat" has the "-chameleon" compile flag for building CHPEV2 ARM64EC files.
